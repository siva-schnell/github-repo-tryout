# GitHub Experience Repository
Trial repository to tryout github features and get experienced with GitHub actions

## Repository Structure
This trial repository contains two branches 'main' and 'develop'
The main branch can be treated as release repository and the develop branch can be treated as the working repository
Anyone can branch from develop and add to the repo files as commits
Once you think that changes are good enough to be merged to the 'develop' branch for all others, then you can create a PR
Once the PR is reviewed for conflicts, it will be merged with the 'develop' branch
Once the owner thinks that the 'develop' branch has reached a milestone where it can be released, a PR for release will be
created from the 'develop' to the 'main' branch and both will be merged after review
